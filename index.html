    <p>   I've been coding for the last year or so now, and I'm really keen to turn this into a career. I've built a Flappy Bird inspired game, my own website for nail art inspiration (my other favourite hobby), and an app that tracks my health condition. My dream career is either a SWE or a SDET :). I was first introduced to coding by my friend who is a SWE in Amsterdam. At first I found it pretty intimidating, but after a few "Hello World!"'s later, my confidence improved and so has my desire to make a career out of coding. I teach myself outside of working full time and I'm currently learning arrays in Java. 
    </p>
    
    <p> One website that has helped me tremendously with coding is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a>. It's helped me learn Java, Javascript, HTML & CSS. And of course, where would I be without <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@programming With Mosh">ProgrammingWithMosh</a>?! My GitHub is: https://github.com/KelsieJM
    </p>
  <p> My goals are as follows </p>
  <ol>
  <li> Get into CYF</li>
  <li> Complete the course</li>
  <li> Secure a career in SWE </li>
    
</ol>
  <p> Languages I would like to be proficient in:
  <ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
</ul>
